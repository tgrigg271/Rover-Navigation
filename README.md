Applied Kalman Filtering Rover Navigation Project

Simulation framework for designing and analyzing navigation and control
architectures for a two-wheel rover. Sensors include a camera with AprilTag
landmarks, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. The navigation and
control algorithms are intended to be directly ported to a RaspberryPi based
rover.
